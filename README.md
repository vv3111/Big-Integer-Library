# BIG INTEGER LIBRARY

• Developed a C++ library for managing arithmetic and logical tasks on integers beyond 64 bits in size.

• Applied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including Operator Overloading and the "this" pointer.

• Encompasses full arithmetic and assignment functionality, covering operators like "%", "+=".

• Integrated optimized bitwise comparison algorithms for "Big Integers".
